								<p>Why We Have The Safest Cities and Structures In The World! <br/> 
                                    Where in your life do you feel the safest? For many of us, it’s behind the dead bolted front door of our own home. Some offices, especially government buildings, take extensive security measures. And then you have the buildings on this list. <br/>
                                Managing risk on a personal, business, or industrial level comes down to having the right security. If important assets and people are safe and sound, then you have much less to worry about. Of course, some particular locations take their protection measures to the next level. We all know that many military facilities come with extra defense standards, but there are also a number of quirkier, less conventional institutions that work to ensure their property and people are secure from both natural and manmade threats.

So where in the world could you be the safest? Following are some of the buildings considered to be the most secure on the planet.</p>
