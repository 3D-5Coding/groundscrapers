									<b><h3>History</h3></b>
								</header>

                              

				<p> 
                                    <img src="https://www.graniteconstruction.com/sites/default/files/styles/history_half/public/2016-03/8.2_History_Slide11_Image_2.jpg?itok=tb28zswV"></p>
                                <br><br>
								
				<p>A banker, and his son founded Granite Construction with $10,000 and a dream to build the wild frontier into a city that would put London to shame.
With prohibition on the brink and the adoption of the 19th amendment, Texas was in turmoil. The forward-thinking men saw an opportunity. They began building hidden speak easies in their buildings, that linked to each other through underground tunnels. The company flourished in its infancy.
They employed 20 men who were paid $2.50 per day for 12-hour, swinging sledgehammers and picks. Employment included room and board, but there was nothing lavish about the accommodations. 
					The ending of prohibition in 1933 set the company back from its previous financial forecast.</p>
							<br>

<p>1936 marking the Texas Centennial, Granite Construction started to dwindle without any new business ideas.</p>
							<br>

<p>June 1943 Beaumont was proclaimed under Marshall Law due to eruptions of riots over race. The city was over overcrowded, along with heightened Ku Klux Klan activity. With intense race riots breaking out all over the country including Detroit, New York, Mobile, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Baltimore, Saint Louis, and Indianapolis this prompted another business idea for Granite Construction, which began their construction of underground bunkers. Business was again booming throughout the decades as fear of war rose. Being a big name in business, they landed a contract to assist in building the Houston Manned Spacecraft Center. The headquarters moved to Houston to continue building the city. They landed their first skyscraper contract in 1965, completing the JP Morgan Chase Tower in 1982. Building the Wells Fargo plaza at the same time, and splitting the team up to work on the Bank of America in Dallas the company grew exponentially. In 1985, the Granite Construction began incorporating their underground bunkers with their skyscrapers. This appeased the business men of power with their business needs, and their need to feel safe and secure.</p>
						<br>

                                <p>With growth and good fortune on its side, Granite Construction acquired Baird and Warner, a real estate business in 2008. Changing the name to Granite and partners, the company began renting out the office spaces of the skyscrapers they built. This business plan proved to be profitable with a 79 Billion Dollar revenue. A technology company proficient in cutting edge SMART building technology was acquired a couple years later. Through creative research and design, a new company emerged with underground skyscrapers, with the name GroundScrapers.</p>
